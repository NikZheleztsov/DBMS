# DBMS

**DBMS** - special-purpose (universities) database management system. The work is still in progress.

All commands are case insensitive (but not names!). Commands are also have to end with semicolon (';'). Here are several guide aliases for custom values: <db> - database name, <tb> - table name, <cl> - column name, <val> - value, <sgn> - sign (=|>|<). For more information type *help* in program.
